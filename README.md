This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native: a FlatList component failing to render data after a successful API call. The issue arises from an improper handling of the loading and error states within the component's lifecycle. The solution focuses on properly managing the loading and error states to ensure that data is correctly rendered. This is a valuable example for React Native developers facing similar rendering problems.
